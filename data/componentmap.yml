#defines association between components, a client component uses one or more server component directly
#to generate its configuration, a device queries all its servers for configuration, recursively
#each server queries its servers for configuration, recursively
#a device also queries all its clients for configuration
#each client queries its servers for configuration, recursively
#a client should keep reference to all its servers
#a server should keep reference to all its clients
